This Git contains a bunch of the templates and stuff that I use for asset making. All templates are made for PS. 

For a whole bunch of other assets and stuff I recommend going to https://gitlab.com/association-of-modders/aom-shared-assets (the AOM repo)

Brief descriptions of everything below -

# backgrounds folder
A whole bunch of pre-existing backgrounds to get you started and to give you parts to make your own. Big thank you to Mapno for providing these to the community. Includes a fan/rays piece.

# rifle.psd
My template for normal assets. After separating the layers, copy the effects from "base" and paste them to the base layer, then copy effects from any other layer and paste them into the separated layers of the asset. Fidget with it as necessary. Keep in mind you'll have to change it for some assets to look more "realistic" (e.g. buildings)

# france.psd
My template for map assets. Just get a normal grey map of your desired place, carry over the effects, and use Burn & Dodge to create lighting. Keep in mind lighting often comes from the left in vanilla
